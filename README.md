This application, built using React.js, allows users to plan their trips while checking the weather forecast for their destinations. Users can perform the following actions:

View Trips: Upon starting the application, users are provided with a static list of trips, with each trip displaying a forecast for each day of the journey. The list is scrollable, ensuring ease of navigation.

Search for Trips: Users can search for specific trips using the search functionality located at the top of the page.

Add New Trip: Users can add a new trip by clicking on the "Add trip" button, which opens a modal window. Within the modal, users can choose a city from a predefined list, enter the start and end dates of the trip (within the next 15 days), and upon clicking "Done," the trip is added to the list.

Weather Display: When a trip is selected, the app displays the weather forecast for each day of the trip. Additionally, the current day's weather forecast for the selected city is shown on the right side of the page.

Countdown Timer: A countdown timer from the current date to the start date of the selected trip is displayed on the right side of the page, aiding users in planning and preparation.
